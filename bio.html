<p><span>I was born </span>in Rochester, New York, and graduated from Churchville-Chili Senior High School. I swam for the varsity team and was on student council. I also participated in Boy Scouts, worked as a swim lesson instructor and lifeguard, and was active in youth ministry at St. Vincent de Paul Roman Catholic Church in Churchville, New York (now part of the <a href="https://www.stmartinrochester.org/">St. Martin de Porres parish cluster</a>).</p>

<p>At the urging of my AP US History teacher, Mrs. Hoelperl, I went to St. Bonaventure University for a Bachelor of Arts. There I received departmental awards in theology and philosophy and was named (together with a classmate of mine from high school!) an <a href="https://www.oleantimesherald.com/two-students-from-same-rochester-area-school-named-2015-ideal-bonaventure-students/article_63ec3d42-fd88-11e4-a5de-6f8abef79450.html">Ideal Bonaventure Student</a> for the class of 2015. I was also involved in Residential Life, University Ministries, and the Running Club.</p>

<p>After graduating from St. Bonaventure I moved to Baltimore to pursue a <a href="https://www.loyola.edu/academics/theology/graduate/mts">Master of Theological Studies at Loyola University Maryland</a>. During my studies I worked as a graduate assistant in Campus Ministry, and cat-sat for <a href="https://www.loyola.edu/news/2020/0424-angela-christman-obit">Angela Russell Christman</a>. My thesis on the motive for the incarnation according to Franciscan scholastic theologian John Duns Scotus, written under the direction of <a href="https://homileticdiakonia.blogspot.com/">Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt</a>, won me the Award for Research in Theology.</p>

<p>From Baltimore I moved to Boston and matriculated in <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/theology.html">Boston Collegeʼs graduate program in theology</a>. While in Boston I lived in the Barton House, an interfaith community of students and young professionals interested in religion, spirituality, and justice; I also <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/2019/05/18/that-attention-is.html">married</a> my wife, Jacqueline.</p>

<p>At Boston College I was trained in historical and systematic theology and developed specialties in medieval theology, Franciscan theology, and christology. In addition to my study of theology, I also earned the <a href="https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/academics/sites/center-for-teaching-excellence/programs-events/graduate-student-programs/Apprenticeship-In-College-Teaching.html">Apprenticeship in College Teaching</a> and served the theology graduate program during the academic year 2020–2021 as its graduate assistant. I defended <a href="https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/foundations-scholastic-christology-em-summa/docview/2629099977/se-2?accountid=45220">my dissertation</a>, titled “Foundations of Scholastic Christology in the <em>Summa halensis</em>,” in October 2021. My dissertation director, <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/theology/people/faculty-directory/boyd-taylor-coolman.html">Boyd Taylor Coolman</a>, <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/2022/05/23/my-dissertation-director.html">hooded</a> me with the Doctor of Philosophyʼs blue velvet in May 2022.</p>

<p>I live in upstate New York now. When Iʼm not teaching or researching, Jacqueline and I are watching movies (we're making our way through the AFIʼs <a href="https://www.afi.com/afis-100-years-100-movies-10th-anniversary-edition/">100 Greatest American Films</a>), exploring the natural beauty of upstate New Yorkʼs wilderness, and <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/travel/">traveling</a> to visit friends and family around the United States.</p>
