My name is Andrew Gertner Belfield, and I'm a theologian who specializes in medieval theology, christology, and Franciscan theology. I teach at [St. Bonaventure University](https://www.sbu.edu/) as an assistant professor in the [department of theology and Franciscan studies](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies). I say a bit about how I understand my role as a teacher [here](/teaching/), if you're interested; as for my research, you can look at my [research page](/research/) or my full *[curriculum vitae](http://andrewbelfield.com/cv/)*. I also serve as book review editor for *[Franciscan Studies](https://www.franciscanpublications.com/pages/journals)*.

For more of what's capturing my interest at the moment, see my [micro.blog](/now/). Though my work as a teacher and a theologian involves plenty of reading, I do a lot of other [reading](https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/reading/) besides (I especially like a good collection of essays and science fiction literature), I've begun to play around with [film photography](https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/film/), and I do a fair amount of [sourdough baking](https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/breads/) (though not as much now that I'm teaching fulltime).

I earned a Bachelor of Arts at St. Bonaventure University, where I received departmental awards in theology and philosophy and was named (together with a classmate of mine from high school!) an [Ideal Bonaventure Student](https://www.oleantimesherald.com/two-students-from-same-rochester-area-school-named-2015-ideal-bonaventure-students/article_63ec3d42-fd88-11e4-a5de-6f8abef79450.html). I then pursued a [Master of Theological Studies at Loyola University Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/academics/theology/graduate/mts); my thesis on the motive for the incarnation according to Franciscan scholastic theologian John Duns Scotus won me the Award for Research in Theology. More recently, I received [a Doctor of Philosophy from Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/theology.html). I defended [my dissertation, titled "Foundations of Scholastic Christology in the *Summa halensis*,"](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/foundations-scholastic-christology-em-summa/docview/2629099977/se-2?accountid=45220) in October 2021.
