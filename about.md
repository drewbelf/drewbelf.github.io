I am Andrew Gertner Belfield, a theologian who specializes in medieval theology, christology, and franciscan theology. I teach at [St. Bonaventure University](https://www.sbu.edu/) as an assistant professor in the [Department of Theology and Franciscan Studies](https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies). I say a bit about how I understand my role as a teacher [here](/teaching/), if you're interested; as for my research, you can look at my [research page](/research/) or my full *[curriculum vitae](http://andrewbelfield.com/cv/)*.

For more of what's capturing my interest at the moment, see my [now](/now/) page.

I earned a B.A. at [St. Bonaventure University](https://www.sbu.edu), where I received departmental awards in theology and philosophy and was named the [Ideal Bonaventure Man](https://www.oleantimesherald.com/two-students-from-same-rochester-area-school-named-2015-ideal-bonaventure-students/article_63ec3d42-fd88-11e4-a5de-6f8abef79450.html). I then earned an [M.T.S. at Loyola University Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/academics/theology/graduate/mts) and wrote a thesis on the motive for the incarnation in John Duns Scotus, for which I was presented the Award for Research in Theology. Most recently, I completed a Ph.D. at Boston College. My dissertation, titled "Foundations of scholastic christology in the *Summa halensis*," was defended in October 2021.
