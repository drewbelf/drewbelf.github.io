<img style="float: left;" src="/images/me.jpg" /> I am Andrew Gertner Belfield, a theologian who studies historical and systematic theology. I specialize in medieval and contemporary christology, and I have competencies in patristic theology, trinitarian theology, medieval apocalypticism, and theologies of history, too. A doctoral candidate at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/theology/), I'm drafting a dissertation on the christology of the *Summa halensis* and its place in the development of scholastic christology.

Before coming to Boston College, I earned a B.A. at [St. Bonaventure University](https://www.sbu.edu), where I received departmental awards in theology and philosophy and was named the [Ideal Bonaventure Man](https://www.oleantimesherald.com/two-students-from-same-rochester-area-school-named-2015-ideal-bonaventure-students/article_63ec3d42-fd88-11e4-a5de-6f8abef79450.html). I then earned an [M.T.S. at Loyola University Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/academics/theology/graduate/mts) and wrote a thesis on the motive for the incarnation in John Duns Scotus, for which I was presented the Award for Research in Theology.  I live in Auburndale, Mass., with Jacqueline, my wife, in an intentional, interreligious community.
