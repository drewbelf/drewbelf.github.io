![me](/images/me.jpg)

I am Andrew Gertner Belfield, a doctoral candidate at Boston College who studies historical and systematic theology. Now in my fourth year in the doctoral program, I'm writing a dissertation on early Franciscan scholastic christology. For more on my research, see my [research page](andrewbelfield.com/research/).

In addition to my work as a student, I have also served Boston College's theology department as a [Teaching Assistant](andrewbelfield.com/teaching/), and I currently serve Boston College's theology graduate program as its Graduate Assistant.

Before coming to Boston College, I earned a B.A. at [St. Bonaventure University](https://www.sbu.edu), where I received departmental awards in theology and philosophy and was named the [Ideal Bonaventure Man](https://www.oleantimesherald.com/two-students-from-same-rochester-area-school-named-2015-ideal-bonaventure-students/article_63ec3d42-fd88-11e4-a5de-6f8abef79450.html). I then earned an [M.T.S. at Loyola University Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/academics/theology/graduate/mts) and wrote a thesis on the motive for the incarnation in John Duns Scotus, for which I was presented the Award for Research in Theology.  I now live in Auburndale, Mass., with Jacqueline, my wife, in an intentional, interreligious community.
