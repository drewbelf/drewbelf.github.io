"What you’ll fail at is everything. You will not maximize your potential. You will not escape time’s grip. But neither can time escape God’s grip; and what God intends to make of both you and it is thankfully not up to you to determine."\
---Phil Christman, on [time management](https://www.plough.com/en/topics/culture/literature/book-tour-the-grip-of-time)
