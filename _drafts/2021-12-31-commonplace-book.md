"So there I was, watching this movie, dinner in the oven and a little drunk, when Scrooge stepped onto the screen and instead of enjoying, as I usually do, his deliciously cold persona, I realized that Scroogeâ€™s life is a tragedy, that *A Christmas Carol* is a story of a man who changes all but too late, and that Scrooge is haunted by time in part because nothing can go back and change the long years of his sorry life into something less blighted and lonely."\

"There is little opiate delusion in Jesus's grim warning to his comrades that if they were true to his Gospel of love and justice, they would meet the same sticky end as him. The measure of your love in his view is whether they kill you or not. Christians who are not an affront to the powers-that-be, so he suggests, are not being faithful to his mission."\

"The way into following Christ inevitably leads to another form of poverty and freedom---the poverty and freedom of love, in which Jesus in the end finally 'outwitted' death itself, since he no longer possessed anything that this could have robbed him of. He had given everything, for everyone. Following Christ is a summons ... to this kind of poverty and freedom of love."\
