"melancholy to realize how much of anyone’s memory is no true memory at all but only the traces of someone else’s memory"
---Joan Didion

"The graves filled last week and the week before that and even last month do not yet have stones, only plastic identification cards, streaked by the mist and splattered with mud. The earth is raw and trampled in that part of the crater, but the grass grows fast, up there in the rain cloud."
---Joan Didion
