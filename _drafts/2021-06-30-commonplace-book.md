"melancholy to realize how much of anyone’s memory is no true memory at all but only the traces of someone else’s memory"  
---Joan Didion

"The graves filled last week and the week before that and even last month do not yet have stones, only plastic identification cards, streaked by the mist and splattered with mud. The earth is raw and trampled in that part of the crater, but the grass grows fast, up there in the rain cloud."  
---Joan Didion

"Surely some revelation is at hand;  
Surely the Second Coming is at hand.  
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out  
When a vast image out of *Spiritus Mundi*  
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert  
A shape with lion body and the head of a man,  
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,  
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it  
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds.  
The darkness drops again; but now I know  
That twenty centuries of stony sleep  
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle,  
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last,  
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"  
---W. B. Yeats

"My name is Mary Katherine Blackwood. I am eighteen years old, and I live with my sister Constance. I have often thought that with any luck at all I could have been born a werewolf, because the two middle fingers on both my hands are the same length, but I have had to be content with what I had. I dislike washing myself, and dogs, and noise. I like my sister Constance, and Richard Plantagenet, and Amanita phalloides, the death-cup mushroom. Everyone else in my family is dead."\
---Shirley Jackson

"we should not despise the difficulty that speaking and thinking about God forces on us. In fact, we should delight in it. In the presence of God, reason does not so much break down as bow down, bending in glad acceptance of its givenness, even while it is happily straining against its limits."\
---Chris Green, [on theological speech](https://www.cewgreen.com/post/living-the-divine-life-reflections-on-preaching-god-as-trinity?s=09)

"To take the doctrine of the Trinity seriously is to say that divinity is now found in people, that they create their own destiny in virtue of his divinity. It is to say that the picture of the prearranged plan worked out by God up there, to which we must conform, is only a provisional picture, an inadequate one. There is no heaven waiting for us; it is we who will create heaven, but only because of the divine life we already have within us… We help to create heaven by failing to make it. The suggestion is paradoxical. But that is what the crucifixion meant. Jesus failed and that is how the kingdom was established."\
---Herbert McCabe, OP
