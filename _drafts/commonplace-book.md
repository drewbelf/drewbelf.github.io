"What is happening? Today there is a great silence over the earth, a great silence, and stillness, a great silence because the King sleeps; the earth was in terror and was still, because God slept in the flesh and raised up those who were sleeping from the ages. God has died in the flesh, and the underworld has trembled."  
---from [an ancient homily for Holy Saturday](http://www.vatican.va/spirit/documents/spirit_20010414_omelia-sabato-santo_en.html)

"O truly blessed night,  
worthy alone to know the time and hour  
when Christ rose from the underworld!"  
--from the [Easter Exultet](https://www.usccb.org/prayer-and-worship/liturgical-year-and-calendar/easter/easter-proclamation-exsultet)

"But the harvest has been dark: the forms of our best rebellious art have become mere gestures, shticks, not only sterile but perversely enslaving. How can, even the idea of rebellion against corporate culture stay meaningful when Chrysler Inc. advertises trucks by invoking 'The Dodge Rebellion'? How is one to be a bona fide iconoclast when Burger King sells onion rings with 'Sometimes You Gotta Break the Rules'?"
