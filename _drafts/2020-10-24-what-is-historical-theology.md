A tradition forms by a process of memory, forgetting, and recalling.[^1] The Christian tradition performs a necessarily conservative function, aiming to hand over the deposit of faith from generation to generation. As such, it constitutes a collective memory, an archive that preserves what is central to the church’s identity. But memory necessarily involves forgetting; the archive lacks space for every aspect of a community’s past, and so some aspects of a tradition must be betrayed (tradere) in order to preserve the tradition’s center. Yet this essential forgetting carries with it a risk: a tradition may unwittingly forget the wrong features and thus stray from its center of gravity. Such situations require a corrective destructio, counterbalancing the wrongful forgetting of a tradition and functioning as a “radical folding back of the tradition to its center.”2 Destructio’s aim is not violence against the tradition nor even a critique of the past, but rather a critique of “insufficient present appropriations of the past,”3 retrieving aspects of the past and making possible again paths-not-taken in the tradition. Thus, recollection is a two-step process—destructio and retrieval—wherein the charred root of a tradition’s meaning is found.
