"I’ve said this in various bits and pieces across the internet and will no doubt say it again but I do think one of the problems of grief today is how much relics of a person’s life don’t age. A text chain always looks new and a Twitter page or a Facebook page always seem like they could be updated. Pictures and videos can age, in terms of quality, but they don’t have to, and are probably increasingly less likely to. But there’s nothing telling you that a person’s gone."\
---B. D. McClay

"We end our consideration of the holy influences on *Laudato Si’* with a startling conclusion. And that is that, if we want to penetrate to the most ultimate account of the origin of the cosmos, beyond even the truths that science can offer us, it is the practice of the preferential option for the poor that will allow us to penetrate the universe’s deepest mystery, its origin out of nothing in a love that once we see it, might tempt us, even in our pride, to cry out, 'Laudato si’, mi’ Signore, Praised be You, my Lord, with all Your creatures!'"\
---John Cavadini, [on *Laudato Si'*](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/augustine-and-francis-the-saints-of-laudato-si)
