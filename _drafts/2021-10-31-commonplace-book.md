"I’ve said this in various bits and pieces across the internet and will no doubt say it again but I do think one of the problems of grief today is how much relics of a person’s life don’t age. A text chain always looks new and a Twitter page or a Facebook page always seem like they could be updated. Pictures and videos can age, in terms of quality, but they don’t have to, and are probably increasingly less likely to. But there’s nothing telling you that a person’s gone."\

"We end our consideration of the holy influences on *Laudato Si’* with a startling conclusion. And that is that, if we want to penetrate to the most ultimate account of the origin of the cosmos, beyond even the truths that science can offer us, it is the practice of the preferential option for the poor that will allow us to penetrate the universe’s deepest mystery, its origin out of nothing in a love that once we see it, might tempt us, even in our pride, to cry out, 'Laudato si’, mi’ Signore, Praised be You, my Lord, with all Your creatures!'"\
---John Cavadini, [on *Laudato Si'*](https://churchlifejournal.nd.edu/articles/augustine-and-francis-the-saints-of-laudato-si)

"God wants Jesus to live this way even though God knows that such a life will get him killed. As a parent, I desire more than anything that my children know the love of God and live according to that knowledge. This means that I desire them to live lives that are free from worldly striving and control, lives of generosity and vulnerability, lives that are marked by a passion for justice and concern for the downtrodden. But I am not naive. I desire this for them knowing well that people who live such lives are often taken advantage of and have to forgo material pleasures and security. I desire this knowing that some may hate them for living such lives and see them as agents of chaos undermining the very foundations of society. I desire this knowing that some may even try to harm them, seeing them as somehow both threatening and defenseless (an irresistible combination for the human impulse to find scapegoats). But even in light of knowing all this, what I desire for them are lives rooted in God's love, not the negative effects that I foresee will likely, perhaps inevitably, accompany such lives when they are lived out in a world that has turned from love. God desires that divine love be incarnate in Jesus, even know ing that this will be too much love for a grasping, frustrated, frightened world to bear. God desires that love be incarnate, even if that love must be crucified."\
