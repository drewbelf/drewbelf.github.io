"I’ve said this in various bits and pieces across the internet and will no doubt say it again but I do think one of the problems of grief today is how much relics of a person’s life don’t age. A text chain always looks new and a Twitter page or a Facebook page always seem like they could be updated. Pictures and videos can age, in terms of quality, but they don’t have to, and are probably increasingly less likely to. But there’s nothing telling you that a person’s gone."\
