<p><span>Hi. Iʼm Andrew Belfield, </span>and Iʼm an <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/faculty/belfield-andrew-gertner">assistant professor</a> of <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies">theology & Franciscan studies</a> at <a href="https://www.sbu.edu">St. Bonaventure University</a>.</p>

<p>I <strong>teach</strong> undergraduate students about <a href="teaching.html">Francis & Clare of Assisi and Catholic theology (inter alia)</a>.</p>

<p>My <strong>research</strong> focuses on <a href="research.html">christology, medieval theology, and Franciscan theology</a>. Iʼm particularly interested in how Franciscan theologians working at the University of Paris in the 1240s developed in their collaborative work—the <em>Summa halensis</em>—developed ways of speaking about God that were informed by their experience living as mendicant friars. You can take a look at my full <em>curriculum vitae</em> <a href="https://andrewbelfield.com/cv">here</a>.</p>
		
<p>As for what Iʼm up to <strong>right now</strong>: take a look at <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com" rel="me">my blog</a>, where I post about some of my interests, including <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/bookshelf/">what Iʼm reading (theology and not)</a>, <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/film/">film photography</a>, and <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/breads/">sourdough baking</a>. I run the blog using <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, which I have found to be a much saner and more enjoyable way of doing social media than, say, Twitter. I encourage you to check it out. If you’re already on Micro.blog, you can <a href="https://micro.blog/drewbelf" rel="me">follow me there (I’m @drewbelf)</a>.</p>
