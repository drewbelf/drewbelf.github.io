		<p><span class="title">Hi. Iʼm Andrew Belfield, </span>& Iʼm an <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/faculty/belfield-andrew-gertner">assistant professor of theology & Franciscan studies</a> at <a href="https://www.sbu.edu">St. Bonaventure University</a>.</p>
		
		<p><span class="heading">I teach courses </span>on Francis & Clare of Assisi & Catholic theology for SBU’s <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum">undergraduate curriculum</a>, along with courses for <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies">majors & minors in theology & Franciscan studies</a>. If you’re interested in learning more about <a href="teaching.html">what it is to study theology</a> or why SBUʼs liberal arts education includes study of theology, feel free to <a href="contact.html">get in touch with me</a>.</p>

		<p><span class="heading">My research agenda </span>focuses on <a href="research.html">christology, medieval theology, & Franciscan theology</a>. Iʼm particularly interested in how Franciscan theologians working at the University of Paris in the 1240s developed in their collaborative work—the <em>Summa halensis</em>—ways of speaking about God that were informed by their experience living as mendicant friars. My <a href="https://andrewbelfield.com/cv"><em>curriculum vitae</em></a> summarizes my scholarly activity (inter alia) so far. If you’d like to discuss my research, I’d welcome <a href="contact.html">a message from you</a>.</p>
		
		<p><span class="heading">As for what Iʼm up to right now: </span>take a look at <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com" rel="me">my blog</a>, where I post about some of my interests, including <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/bookshelf/">what Iʼm reading (theology & not)</a>, <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/film/">film photography</a>, & <a href="https://now.andrewbelfield.com/categories/breads/">sourdough baking</a>. I run the blog using <a href="https://micro.blog">Micro.blog</a>, which I have found to be a much saner & more enjoyable way of doing social media than, say, Twitter. I encourage you to check it out. If you’re already on Micro.blog, you can <a href="https://micro.blog/drewbelf" rel="me">follow me there (I’m @drewbelf)</a>. You can read a bit about <a href="bio.html">my background</a>, too.</p>
