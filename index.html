		<span>Hi. Iʼm Andrew Belfield.</span>
		</p>
    	
		<p>Iʼm an <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies">assistant professor of theology & Franciscan studies</a> at <a href="https://www.sbu.edu">St. Bonaventure University</a>. I <strong>teach</strong> courses primarily on Francis & Clare of Assisi and Catholic theology, but I sometimes get to teach elective courses on other topics including christology, history of Christianity, and (hopefully in spring 2022) faith & doubt. Iʼll also be teaching an intermediate Latin course this fall. You can read more about how I understand my role as a teacher <a href="teaching.html">here</a>.</p>

		<p>My <strong>research</strong> focuses on christology, medieval theology, and Franciscan theology. My dissertation, titled <a href="https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/foundations-scholastic-christology-em-summa/docview/2629099977/se-2?accountid=45220">“Foundations of Scholastic Christology in the <em>Summa halensis</em>,”</a> appreciated the early Franciscansʼ distinctive take on the person and work of Jesus Christ, attending especially to their efforts to unite speculative and practical theological aims in their christology. I am currently revising my dissertation for publication as a monograph; the monograph will situate the <em>Summa halensis</em> in the broader trajectory of scholastic christology.</p>
        
		<p>I’m also in the process of <strong>translating</strong> Book III of Alexander of Hales’s <em>Glossa</em> on Peter Lombard’s <em>Four Books of Sentences</em> for <a href="https://dallasmedievaltexts.org/alexander-of-hales-project/">Dallas Medieval Texts & Translations</a>. I’m producing this translation in collaboration with <a href="http://www.stmarys.edu/seminary/faculty/dr-eric-mabry/">Eric Mabry</a> of St. Mary’s Seminary and University. Alexander was among the first professors at the University of Paris to incorporate the Lombard’s Sentences into his curriculum, making him an important and authoritative teacher of what would become the standard textbook for theologians during the medieval period.</p>
