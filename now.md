With the end of my first semester teaching full-time, I'm in the process of reimagining and reworking my courses for the spring. That means I'm thinking a lot about Francis and Clare and how they interpret and re-present the gospel for people today.

My reading is a little disparate right now. I'm slowly working through [Alberto Manguel's *A History of Reading*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317083/a-history-of-reading-by-alberto-manguel/); catching up on Issue 25 of [The Point](https://thepointmag.com/) before Issue 26 lands in my mailbox; and listening to [*The Power* by Naomi Alderman](https://bookshop.org/books/the-power/9780316547604) on audiobook. I have a long list of books I hope to read over the winter break; we'll see how that goes.

I'm not baking as much sourdough bread as I used to (gainful employment has not much helped my hobbies, regrettably), but I'm hoping to get back into it over the winter break.
