# teaching

With the end of my first semester teaching full-time, I'm in the process of reimagining and reworking my courses for the spring. That means I'm thinking a lot about Francis and Clare and how they interpret and re-present the gospel for people today. I have a course schedule I'm pretty happy with; now it's a matter of finding the right texts for each class.

I'll teach in the spring my catholic theology course again. I think that course can more or less stay the same, though I am going to tweak a few units.

I'm developing a christology course, too, for the spring. This one I'm excited about, though teaching on my research expertise is a little intimidating, too.

# reading

My reading is a little disparate right now. I'm slowly working through [Alberto Manguel's *A History of Reading*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/317083/a-history-of-reading-by-alberto-manguel/); catching up on Issue 25 of [The Point](https://thepointmag.com/) before Issue 26 lands in my mailbox; and listening to [*The Power* by Naomi Alderman](https://bookshop.org/books/the-power/9780316547604) on audiobook. I have a long list of books I hope to read over the winter break; we'll see how that goes.

# listening

To be honest, my music listening as gotten a little stale. I've been listening to the members of [boygenius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T5zc36sAIE) (including boygenius) pretty consistently over the past several months---probably too much. [Olivia Rodrigo's recent NPR Tiny Desk concert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGczofguB0c) was delightful; she seems to bring fresh emotion each time she performs. At my friend Nathan's suggestion, I've been listening to the soundtrack for *The Green Knight*, which is equal parts Christmas-y and creepy. It served me well as a companion to grading finals.

No new podcasts to report; I continue to enjoy the [Indiana Jones Minute](https://www.indianajonesminute.com/), along with [Know Your Enemy](https://know-your-enemy-1682b684.simplecast.com/).

# fun

I'm not baking as much sourdough bread as I used to (gainful employment has not much helped my hobbies, regrettably), but I'm hoping to get back into it over the winter break.

Jacqueline and I are hoping to take a trip to New York City this January, to visit my brother and one of our dearest friends.
