		<p><span class="heading">To study theology </span>is to ask questions about God & things pertaining to God, & to think critically about possible answers. Students of theology don’t do this unaided; in the archive that is the history of Christian theology sits an enormous catalog of methods, questions, approaches, answers, & discussions from a diversity of thinkers, traditions, & communities.</p>

		<p>My teaching aims, in part, to show students how to explore that archive & put its materials to use as they navigate these fundamental questions of human existence & divine reality. In this way, I convey to my students the wide diversity of Christian thinking about God while also modeling intellectual work as always embedded in communities or traditions.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, as a teacher I invite my students to inhabit, if only provisionally, these communities of thinking about God: asking their questions, assessing their answers, & communicating these ideas effectively.</p>
		
		<p>I teach courses on Francis & Clare of Assisi & Catholic theology for SBU’s <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum">undergraduate curriculum</a>, along with courses for <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies">majors & minors</a> in theology & Franciscan studies. This spring I’m teaching two courses I’ve taught before: a couple sections of “The Way of Francis & Clare” & a couple sections of “Catholic Theology.” While I’m still making minor tweaks to both courses (especially where assignments are concerned), I’ve more or less settled on a reading schedule that works. In addition to those, I’ve also taught the following courses:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>Catholic Theology;</li>
			<li>Jesus through the Centuries;</li>
			<li>Bonaventure—Life & Writings;</li>
			<li>Early Christian History to the Reformation; &</li>
			<li>Intermediate Latin.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>I’ve also proposed a courses titled “Theology through Film,” which has been approved by SBU’s Faculty Senate. I plan to teach that course in the fall.</p>
