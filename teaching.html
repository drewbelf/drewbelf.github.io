		<p><span class="heading">To study theology </span>is to ask questions of and about God and to think critically about possible answers. Students of theology don’t do this unaided; in the archive that is the history of Christian theology sits an enormous catalog of methods, questions, approaches, answers, and discussions from a diversity of thinkers, traditions, and communities.</p>

<p>My teaching aims, in part, to show students how to explore that archive and put its materials to use as they navigate these fundamental questions of human existence and divine reality. In this way, I convey to my students the wide diversity of Christian thinking about God while also modeling intellectual work as always embedded in a community or tradition.</p>

<p>Ultimately, as a teacher I invite my students to inhabit, if only provisionally, this community of thinking about God, asking its questions, assessing its answers, and communicating these ideas effectively.</p>

<p>So far at St. Bonaventure Iʼve taught the following courses:</p>
		
<ul><li>The Way of Francis & Clare;</li>
<li>Catholic Theology; and</li>
<li>Jesus through the Centuries.</li></ul>

<p>This fall Iʼm teaching a course on the history of Christianity up to the Reformation and an intermediate Latin course, along with “The Way of Francis & Clare” and “Catholic Theology.” For next academic year, I hope to develop a course on the life and writings of St. Bonaventure and, the year after that, a course on theology and film.</p>
