		<p><span class="heading">To study theology </span>is to ask questions of & about God & to think critically about possible answers. Students of theology don’t do this unaided; in the archive that is the history of Christian theology sits an enormous catalog of methods, questions, approaches, answers, & discussions from a diversity of thinkers, traditions, & communities.</p>

		<p>My teaching aims, in part, to show students how to explore that archive & put its materials to use as they navigate these fundamental questions of human existence & divine reality. In this way, I convey to my students the wide diversity of Christian thinking about God while also modeling intellectual work as always embedded in a community or tradition.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, as a teacher I invite my students to inhabit, if only provisionally, this community of thinking about God: asking its questions, assessing its answers, & communicating these ideas effectively.</p>
		
		<p>I teach courses on Francis & Clare of Assisi & Catholic theology for SBU’s <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/general-education-curriculum">undergraduate curriculum</a>, along with courses for <a href="https://www.sbu.edu/academics/theology-and-franciscan-studies">majors & minors</a> in theology & Franciscan studies. So far Iʼve taught the following courses:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li>The Way of Francis & Clare;</li>
			<li>Catholic Theology;</li>
			<li>Jesus through the Centuries;</li>
			<li>Early Christian History to the Reformation; &</li>
			<li>Intermediate Latin.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>In the spring Iʼm teaching two sections each of “The Way of Francis & Clare” & “Catholic Theology”; the latter especially has been substantially revised from the last few times Iʼve taught the course. Iʼm in the process of developing a course on the life & writings of St. Bonaventure for next academic year &, the year after that, a course on theology & film.</p>
