![Alexander of Hales teaches Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas](/images/ex alexandri halensis commentarii in apocalypsim_1647_angelicum docuit doctorem seraphicumque_resized.png){: .img-left}

I am trained as a historical and systematic theologian, with specializations in medieval theology (particularly early mendicant theologies) and christology. I also have competencies in patristic theology, soteriology, trinitarian theology, modern doctrines of God, and medieval apocalypticism/Joachimism.

My dissertation studies the christology of the *Summa halensis*, a collaborative work of the Franciscans at the University of Paris during the early 1240s, and its place in the development of scholastic christology.

I'm also translating Book III, distinctions 1--22, of Alexander of Hales' *Glossa in quatuor libros Sententiarum* for the Dallas Medieval Texts & Translations series. Alexander was among the first to lecture from Peter Lombard's *Sentences*, which text would become the standard textbook for the study of theology in high scholasticism. Along with the translation itself, I'll also compose a scholarly introduction to the text.

The image here, taken from a 1647 edition of a commentary on the Apocalypse attributed to Alexander of Hales, depicts Alexander teaching Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure.
