I am trained as a historical and systematic theologian, with specializations in the medieval period (particularly early mendicant theologies) and christology. I also have competencies in patristic theology, trinitarian theology, modern doctrines of God, medieval apocalypticism and Joachimism, and theologies of history.

My dissertation, which I am currently writing, studies the place of the *Summa halensis* in the development of scholastic christology.
