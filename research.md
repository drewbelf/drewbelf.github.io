I am trained as a historical and systematic theologian, with specializations in the medieval period (particularly early mendicant theologies) and christology. I also have competencies in patristic theology, soteriology, trinitarian theology, modern doctrines of God, and medieval apocalypticism/Joachimism.

My dissertation studies the place of the *Summa fratris Alexandri*, a collaborative work of the Franciscans at the University of Paris during the early 1240s, in the development of scholastic christology.
