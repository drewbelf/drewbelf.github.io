![Alexander of Hales teaches Bonaventure and Thomas Aquinas](/images/ex alexandri halensis commentarii in apocalypsim_1647_angelicum docuit doctorem seraphicumque_resized.png){: .img-left}

My training lies in historical and systematic theology, with specializations in medieval theology (particularly early mendicant theologies) and christology. I also have competencies in patristic theology, soteriology, trinitarian theology, modern doctrines of God, and medieval apocalypticism/joachimism. 

I'm currently preparing for publication a monograph on the christology of the *Summa halensis*, a collaborative work of the franciscans at the University of Paris during the early 1240s. In addition to presenting the key commitments and emphases of this early franciscan reflection on Christ and his work, this study will also consider the place of the *Summa halensis* in the development of scholastic christology more broadly. This monograph will extend the research begun in my doctoral dissertation, "Foundations of scholastic christology in the *Summa halensis*."

Alongside this research, I'm also in the process of translating Book III of Alexander of Hales's *Glossa* on Peter Lombard's *Four Books of Sentences* for [Dallas Medieval Texts & Translations](https://dallasmedievaltexts.org/alexander-of-hales-project/). I'm producing this translation in collaboration with [Eric Mabry](http://www.stmarys.edu/seminary/faculty/dr-eric-mabry/) of St. Mary's Seminary and University. Alexander was among the first professors at the University of Paris to incorporate the Lombard's *Sentences* into his curriculum, making him an important and authoritative teacher of what would become the standard textbook for theologians during the medieval period.

The image here, taken from a 1647 edition of a commentary on the Apocalypse attributed to Alexander of Hales, depicts Alexander teaching Thomas Aquinas and Bonaventure.
