		<p><span class="heading">My research </span>specialties include <span class="keyword">medieval theology</span> (particularly <span class="keyword">early mendicant theologies</span>) & <span class="keyword">christology</span>. I also have research interests in soteriology, poverty, apocalypticism (medieval & contemporary), & trinitarian theology.</p>

		<p>Iʼm currently preparing for publication a <span class="keyword">monograph</span> on the christology of the <em>Summa halensis</em>, a collaborative work of the Franciscans at the University of Paris during the early 1240s. In this book, tentatively titled <em>Christ the Penitent: The Early Franciscans & Scholastic Theology</em>, I intend to show how the <em>fratres</em> developed what I have come to call a ‘penitential christology’: Christ makes satisfaction for sin not by dying, but by feeling contrition at human sin.</p>
		
		<p>In addition to presenting the key commitments & emphases of this early Franciscan reflection on Christ & his work, this study will also consider the place of the <em>Summa halensis</em> in the development of scholastic christology more broadly. This monograph will revise & extend the research begun in <a href="https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/foundations-scholastic-christology-em-summa/docview/2629099977/se-2?accountid=45220">my doctoral dissertation</a>, “Foundations of Scholastic Christology in the <em>Summa halensis</em>.”</p>
		
		<p>Iʼm also in the process of <span class="keyword">translating</span> Book III of Alexander of Halesʼs <em>Glossa</em> on Peter Lombardʼs <em>Four Books of Sentences</em> for <a href="https://dallasmedievaltexts.org/alexander-of-hales-project/">Dallas Medieval Texts & Translations</a>. Iʼm producing this translation in collaboration with <a href="http://www.stmarys.edu/seminary/faculty/dr-eric-mabry/">Eric Mabry</a> of St. Maryʼs Seminary & University. Alexander was among the first masters at the University of Paris to incorporate the Lombardʼs <em>Sentences</em> into his curriculum, making him an important & authoritative teacher of what would become the standard textbook for theologians during the medieval period.</p>
		
		<p>And, I serve the journal <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/journal/457"><em>Franciscan Studies</em></a> as its <span class="keyword">book review editor</span>. If you have a title you would like to see reviewed in <em>Franciscan Studies</em> or if you would like to review a title, please contact me at <span id="email">abelfiel at sbu dot edu</span>.</p>
