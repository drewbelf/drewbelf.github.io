                    <![CDATA[
                    <p>Dear C—,<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This past Sunday, on a cool and bright New York day with the edges of autumn just beginning to creep into the last days of summer, you were baptized. Like autumn into summer, you may find the fact of your baptism—something in which you had no say and of which you have no memory—creeping into your life in strange and unexpected ways; you may not know quite why you were baptized; you may wonder what the point of your baptism was at all. I write this note in the hope it can offer some guidance here. Given the subject matter, this note is woefully short (despite its length!), but I hope it’s helpful even still.</p>

<p>The joys of life are many, and you’ll come to learn these in time—riding a bike without training wheels, enjoying a meal you helped to prepare, reading a book your mom loved when she was your age. But when you have enjoyed all life has to offer and when you come to the end of your time on earth, there life’s final obligation imposes itself. If you’ll allow me to be blunt: all living things—human beings, animals, plants—must die. Even nonliving things tend toward decay—given enough time, rocks break down into sand, stars explode into stardust, houses fall apart. This is an unfortunate, tragic, unsettling fact, but a fact nonetheless.</p>

<p>But it is exactly because of this burden of death that your parents had you baptized. Baptism, you see, is a remedy to the death into which all living things are born. When you were baptized, water was poured over your head three times. This ritual symbolically—though as Catholics we really ought to say “sacramentally”—puts the person being baptized to death; when she is lifted out of the baptismal font, she is raised to new life and made a member of the community founded by Christ and made up of all the baptized. This community—which we call “the church”—is freed by baptism from the reign of death and liberated into a reign of life. The freedom of the Christian is a freedom to live in and by the love of God—a love that is totally selfless and pure, concerned never for itself but always for the other.</p>

<p>But just as being born naturally imposed upon you an obligation of death, so does being reborn sacramentally impose upon you an obligation. And as you would expect, the obligation baptism imposes is exactly the opposite of the one imposed by being born: the baptized are obliged to live!</p>

<p>Christians have a peculiar understanding of what it is to live; peculiar, at least, according to how the rest of the world tends to think of what it is to live. For Christians to live, they must live for others—they must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, take in the stranger, visit the imprisoned. (For more on this, see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=RSVCE">chapter 25 of Matthew’s Gospel</a>; or the Sermon on the Mount, found in <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+5-7&amp;version=RSVCE">chapters 5–7 of the same Gospel</a>.) And very often, Christians must inconvenience themselves to live in this way—they must feed the hungry with their own food, clothe the naked with their own clothing, take the stranger into their own home, and visit the imprisoned on their own time. (St. Basil the Great says the unworn jacket in your closet rightfully belongs to the poor person who has no jacket!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>) In this way, the life you received in your baptism is not so much yours as it is others’, especially those most in need of your help.</p>

<p>This obligation to live liberates us from the relentless rhythm of decay, that dirge of death according to which the rest of the world marches. Yet that baptismal obligation is not always pleasant—as I’ve just suggested, it involves a personal cost to the Christian. You may find yourself with less food than you might otherwise have because you’ve given some to your hungry neighbor, for example. What’s more, you may find the task itself unpleasant. The hungry might lack table manners, or the poor decorum; the stranger’s unusual customs might confuse you, and the prisoner’s past might frighten. (<a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Vincent_de_Paul">St. Vincent de Paul has some really lovely words on this</a>; I remain forever haunted by his claim: “It is only for your love alone that the poor will forgive you the bread you give to them.” I have tears in my eyes as I recall my own failings in this respect.)</p>

<p>There’s another reason why we might shy away from baptism’s obligation (and many, regrettably, do). The obligation of baptism to live runs directly contrary to the world and its designs. Unlike the white garment of life that the baptized wear, the world wears a death shroud and, wittingly or not, the world seeks to shroud more of the living in death. There’s a reason, after all, that there are people without enough food, or too poor for clothing or a home, or lacking the freedom you enjoy. For the Christian to live her life for others, then, and for her to spread life in a world of death, is a subversive, even dangerous, undertaking. Indeed, the Christian seeks nothing less than liberation for all those bound by chains of death: liberation from hunger and poverty, and, yes, from the literal chains of the prison yard. The Christian seeks to undo, once and for all, the pattern of death in the world. (For more on this, see <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=luke+1%3A47-55&amp;version=RSVCE">Mary’s Magnificat toward the end of the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke</a>.)</p>

<p>This is the sort of subversive, dangerous trouble Jesus got himself into. He came into a world of death preaching a message of life and love; he rejected the status quo and sought to undo the patterns of death that keep all, oppressors and oppressed alike, in chains. But the powers that be would not stand for it; they dealt with the problem in the only way they knew how, and they had him killed. Ironically, it was this very act of violence against life that assured the final victory of life over death (but that’s another email for another time; in the meantime, you might take a look at <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+cor+15%3A35-58&amp;version=RSVCE">chapter 15 of Paul’s First Letter to the Corinthians, especially verses 35 and following</a>).</p>

<p>The life that your baptism demands of you is subversive: for this reason, the world may try to stop you, as it did Jesus. There will be some who take advantage of your generosity; there will be some who ridicule you for what they take to be foolishness on your part; there may even be some who commit acts of violence against you, so desperate will they be to stop the liberation you bring. I hope this is not the case for you; but I also hope that you take the demands of your baptism seriously, and that you live the life you have been freed to live. St. Irenaeus, one of the first theologians in the church’s history, said that the glory of God is the human being fully alive. I hope you glorify God in all that you do by rejecting death and choosing to be fully alive for the liberation of yourself and of all.</p>

<p>Perhaps you find yourself inspired by the liberating power of your baptism; perhaps you find yourself daunted at the prospect of such a demanding life; perhaps you find yourself vaguely annoyed at having spent so much time reading all this nonsense! (I hope it’s not that last one, but I’m aware it’s at least a possibility.) However you respond to this—whether positively, negatively, or even indifferently—I hope you know there are people in your life who will always be available to talk to you about this. Your mom and dad rightly saw the good of baptism and so decided it was for you; your aunt V— and uncle B— as your godparents, have a special responsibility to guide you in matters of faith and spirituality; and I hope you’ll think of me as someone you can talk to about this. I promise you’ll always find in these people generous listeners, patient conversation partners, and loving family members. I look forward to the day we can talk about some of this, but until then I remain—</p>

<p>your uncle by law and your brother in Christ,<br />

                    <p><img src="/images/wedding-hands.jpg" alt="wedding-hands" /></p>

<p>In the very year of our engagement, <em>Lady Bird</em> was released.<br />
Toward the end of this magnanimous film<br />
the titular character meets with her English teacher, Sister Sarah Joan,<br />
to discuss a short story she wrote for class.<br />
That wise nun comments how clearly<br />
Lady Bird’s love for Sacramento comes through,<br />
much to Lady Bird’s — and the viewer’s— surprise.<br />
Up till now we have seen Lady Bird straining<br />
at the borders of her hometown<br />
and dreaming of going to college<br />
where there is, as she puts it, “culture”—<br />
somewhere like New York City,<br />
or at least, she says naively, Connecticut<br />
Unwilling to call what she feels for Sacramento love,<br />
Lady Bird demurs, saying,<br />
“I guess I pay attention.”
Sister Sarah Joan, sage-like, responds,<br />
“Don’t you think maybe they are the same thing?<br />
Love and attention?”</p>

<p>Jacqueline,<br />
whom I now have the great and singular joy to call my wife,<br />
is someone who pays attention.<br />
How else to explain her acute focus,<br />
an enviable ability to block out all distractions and interruptions?<br />
How else to explain her fascination with<br />
and appreciation for art in all its forms,<br />
her own deeply-felt artistic expression in song and in dance?<br />
Indeed it is by this very attention<br />
that Jacqueline sees the world insightfully and perceptively,<br />
that she recognizes with clarity the virtues and vices and motivations<br />
of those whom she encounters in life and in literature.<br />
I recall our earliest conversations at St. Bonaventure,<br />
where we sat in Hickey Dining Hall<br />
long after our plates had been emptied and our stomachs filled,<br />
as we canvassed literature, film, television, and, most of all, music.<br />
Though I did not realize it at the time,<br />
what drew me to her,<br />
besides her evident beauty—<br />
and the prospect of dating a third-generation SBU legacy—<br />
was her keen sense of the world, borne out of a piercing eye.<br />
It was breathtaking,<br />
enlightening,<br />
challenging,<br />
delighting.</p>

<p>In what can only be called a miracle of divine grace,<br />
Jacqueline has turned her attentive gaze to me.<br />
To be beheld by Jacqueline is thrilling.<br />
She is a source of comfort,<br />
sharing in my hopes and joys, my griefs and anxieties.<br />
She provides refuge from the lonely, isolating, solitary world I inhabit<br />
of dusty books and long-forgotten names.<br />
Under her eyes, I am not anonymous;<br />
I am seen.<br />
But to be beheld by Jacqueline can be frightening indeed.<br />
Jacqueline sees right through all my pretenses,<br />
through the false self by which I delude<br />
(or attempt to delude)<br />
the world and myself.<br />
She knows when I complain about my colleagues<br />
I really give voice to my own insecurities.<br />
She knows my impatience with others<br />
only masks my own frustration with myself.<br />
I cannot but read myself into<br />
the lover of the <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Song+of+Songs+2%3A8-10%2C+14%2C+16a%3B+8%3A6-7a&amp;version=NABRE">Song of Songs</a>;<br />
in the eyes of his beloved, he delights:<br />
“How beautiful you are, my love, how beautiful!<br />
Your eyes are doves!” (1:15).<br />
But from those very eyes, he shrinks:<br />
“Turn your eyes away from me, for they disturb me” (6:5).<br />
Jacqueline sees me, and so I delight.<br />
Yet it is precisely because she sees me that I cower,<br />
for she misses nothing—<br />
not my shame, nor my sin.</p>

<p>Jacqueline,<br />
in other words,<br />
sees me not only as I am now—<br />
sinful indeed and a poor excuse for a Christian—<br />
but also as I could be; rather, as I should be.<br />
Her probing stare exhorts me to be who I am created to be—<br />
<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5%3A1-12a&amp;version=NABRE">poor in spirit and meek</a>,<br />
hungering and thirsting for justice,<br />
clean of heart and peacemaking.<br />
Sometimes she does this outright,<br />
gently and charitably chiding me when I deserve it—<br />
but most times it is her modeling of Christian discipleship,<br />
her lived embodiment of those beatitudes<br />
that points me away from sin and darkness<br />
and toward righteousness and light.<br />
Saint Francis of Assisi is attributed as saying,<br />
“Preach the Gospel always;<br />
when necessary, use words.”<br />
Though he surely uttered no such thing,<br />
Jacqueline lives that proverb ceaselessly.</p>

<p>Indulge me still further.<br />
Marriage,<br />
as a sacrament in the Catholic sense,<br />
is shaped and normed by the cross.<br />
In all sacraments, no less marriage,<br />
we die on the cross with Christ,<br />
and with him leave behind an empty tomb.<br />
In our sacramental dying and rising<br />
is anticipated our physical dying and rising.<br />
Every time a sinner submits to baptism’s watery grave,<br />
every time the one bloody sacrifice is celebrated<br />
with the unbloody words this is my body,<br />
every time two persons die to their selves<br />
and consent to the union in which they rise together as one,<br />
Death’s claim over us is broken.<br />
This is God’s wisdom, foolishness to the world,<br />
that by death itself God should bring life.<br />
Rightly does the Apostle Paul—and do we—<br />
rejoice with words mocking:<br />
“Where, O Death, is your sting?”</p>

<p>Put otherwise,<br />
the process of dying and rising in the sacraments<br />
is nothing other than the process of entering into eternal life,<br />
wherein the last enemy Death finally is defeated.<br />
To be married in this life is to be made ready<br />
for <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=revelation+19&amp;version=NABRE">the wedding-feast in the life to come</a>,<br />
where we all shall be wedded to the Lamb whose victory the cross is.<br />
In my marital, sacramental life with Jacqueline,<br />
and under the clear, precise, charitable, demanding gaze<br />
by which Jacqueline attends to me,<br />
I work out the salvation Christ has wrought.<br />
I am not saved except for her love,<br />
that is to say her <em>attention</em>,<br />
a love and attention that reform me<br />
not in in her image or in mine,<br />
but in the image of the LORD.<br />
This is God’s providential plan for me;<br />
these are the means by which God,<br />
in His mercy,<br />
has ordained that I shall be saved.<br />
It could not be otherwise.<br />
Without Jacqueline I turn my face from His face,<br />
to my own peril;<br />
with her, I shall look upon the face of the LORD as a friend,<br />
in life eternal.<br />
I know not why God has entrusted her to my care—<br />
for I, as Jacqueline’s spouse, must do the same for her—<br />
but thanks be that God has seen fit to entrust me to hers.</p>
