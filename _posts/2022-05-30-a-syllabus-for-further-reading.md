summary: selected texts in catholic theology
categories: theology
---

For the past couple semesters now, I've taught a course on Catholic theology. Since, for many of these students, mine is the last class they'll take in theology, I like to leave them with a list of suggestions for further reading. Here's the list I distributed at the end of the spring 2022 syllabus. I developed this list based on my students' interests, selecting texts that I thought might help them explore these interests more fully.

Of course, throughout the semester my students and I read together selections of many longer texts (e.g., Gustavo Gutiérrez’s *On Job*; Paul Griffiths’s *The Practice of Catholic Theology*; Augustine’s *Confessions*; James Cone’s *The Cross and the Lynching Tree*; Sarah Coakley’s *God, Sexuality, and the Self*; and David Bentley Hart’s *That All Shall Be Saved*; among others). I recommend the full text of these to any students who enjoyed or were intrigued by any of those selections, too.

Frederick Christian Bauerschmidt, *The Love That Is God: An Invitation to Christian Faith* (Eerdmans, 2020). This text is, in my opinion, the single best presentation of the mystery of Christian faith. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/the-love-that-is-god-an-invitation-to-christian-faith/9780802877956).

Ilia Delio, *Simply Bonaventure: An Introduction to His Life, Thought, and Writings*, 2nd ed. (New City Press, 2013). If you’re interested in Franciscan theology, this accessible text introduces the key theological impulses of one of the most important Franciscan theologians in history (not to mention the namesake of our university). [link](https://bookshop.org/books/simply-bonaventure-2nd-edition-an-introduction-to-his-life-thought-and-writings/9781565484849).

Rebecca Konyndyk DeYoung, *Glittering Vices: A New Look at the Seven Deadly Sins and Their Remedies*, 2nd ed. (Brazos Press, 2020). Why do humans behave in death-dealing rather than life-giving ways? DeYoung pursues this question by reflection on the vicious habits human develop. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/glittering-vices-a-new-look-at-the-seven-deadly-sins-and-their-remedies-9781587434402/9781587434402).

Terry Eagleton, *On Evil* (Yale University Press, 2010). Eagleton—a literary critic rather than a theologian, but one with deeply Catholic sensibilities—studies evil in much the same terms we discussed in class, though in much greater depth. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/on-evil-9780300151060/9780300171259).

Shūsaku Endō, *Silence: A Novel*, trans. William Johnston (Picador, 2016). This harrowing novel about Jesuit missionaries in seventeenth-century Japan, brilliantly adapted for film by director Martin Scorsese, explores the demands of Christian faith in the face of hostility and injustice. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/silence-9781250082244/9781250082244).

Paul J. Griffiths, *Intellectual Appetite: A Theological Grammar* (The Catholic University of America Press, 2009). In his idiosyncratic way, Griffiths offers a treatment of human knowing—what it is to know, why humans desire to know, where human knowing falls short, etc.—from a Catholic theological perspective. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/intellectual-appetite-a-theological-grammar/9780813216867).

David Bentley Hart, *The Experience of God: Being, Consciousness, Bliss* (Yale University Press, 2013). Hart, an Eastern Orthodox theologian, draws upon various religious traditions (including Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Vedantic and Bhaktic Hinduism, Sikhism, and some late antique paganisms) to develop an understanding of God suited to a secularizing world. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/the-experience-of-god-being-consciousness-bliss/9780300209358).

John F. Haught, *God after Darwin: A Theology of Evolution* (Westview Press, 2000). In one of the very few books on this subject, Haught performs the project of ‘faith seeking understanding’ by arguing that the concept of ‘novelty’ can serve as a link between Christian theology and contemporary evolutionary theory. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/god-after-darwin-a-theology-of-evolution/9780813343709).

Elizabeth A. Johnson, *She Who Is: The Mystery of God in Feminist Theological Discourse*, Twenty-fifth Anniversary Edition (Crossroad Publishing Company, 2017). In this groundbreaking study in feminist theology, Johnson argues for a rediscovery of the feminine in the Christian understanding of God. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/she-who-is-the-mystery-of-god-in-feminist-theological-discourse/9780824522070).

Herbert McCabe, *God Matters* (Bloomsbury Continuum, 2012). This collection of essays is learned, witty, and accessible; you might look at any of McCabe’s other volumes (*God Still Matters*; *God, Christ & Us*; *The New Creation*; *Faith within Reason*; etc.), too, but this is a good place to start. (You may remember McCabe’s ‘hole-in-a-sock’ analogy for evil that we discussed in class.) [link](https://bookshop.org/books/god-matters-9780264675046/9780264675046).

Thomas Merton, *New Seeds of Contemplation* (New Directions Book, 2007). One-time English professor at St. Bonaventure University, Thomas Merton grounds this masterpiece on the spiritual life (originally published in 1949) in his experience as a Cistercian monk, engaging modern questions of authenticity and the self. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/new-seeds-of-contemplation/9780811217248).

Kaya Oakes, *The Defiant Middle: How Women Claim Life’s In-Betweens to Remake the World* (Broadleaf Books, 2021). Catholic writer Kaya Oakes considers various women throughout history (many of them, Catholic saints) to learn what embodiment and spirituality have to do with one another. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/the-defiant-middle-how-women-claim-life-s-in-betweens-to-remake-the-world/9781506467689).

Timothy Radcliffe, *What Is the Point of Being a Christian?* (Burns & Oates, 2005). Radcliffe (a Dominican friar—don’t tell our Franciscans on campus!) attempts to answer the titular question by considering how Christian faith shapes the Christian’s life. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/what-is-the-point-of-being-a-christian/9780860123699).

Joseph Ratzinger, *Introduction to Christianity*, 2nd ed. (Ignatius Press, 2004). Joseph Ratzinger, better known as Pope Benedict XVI, offers an extended commentary on the apostle’s creed that functions as a systematic theology in nuce. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/introduction-to-christianity-2nd-edition-revised/9781586170295).

Fleming Rutledge, *The Crucifixion: Understanding the Death of Jesus Christ* (Eerdmans 2017). A preacher in the Episcopal tradition, Rutledge discusses exhaustively the images and interpretations of the cross in the Bible and throughout Christian history. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/the-crucifixion-understanding-the-death-of-jesus-christ/9780802875341).

Olga M. Segura, *Birth of a Movement: Black Lives Matter and the Catholic Church* (Orbis Books, 2021). This book examines racial justice through a Christian lens, seeking how Catholic social teaching and Black Lives Matter can work together in pursuit of racial justice. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/birth-of-a-movement-black-lives-matter-and-the-catholic-church/9781626984202).

Linn Marie Tonstad, *Queer Theology: Beyond Apologetics* (Cascade Books, 2018). For a long time, ‘queer theology’ has primarily sought to explain why non-normative sexualities and gender expressions are not incompatible with Christianity; here, Tonstad attempts to move beyond this strategy to a more constructive approach to a ‘queered’ Christianity. [link](https://bookshop.org/books/queer-theology/9781498218795).
