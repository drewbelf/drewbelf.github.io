Good and gracious God,  
you who are power and wisdom and goodnessâ€”

Bless this tree,  
a sign of life and freshness and perseverance in our midst.

May it stand as a reminder  
of light in the dark of night,  
and of life in the dead of winter.

May its supple branches and sharp, sweet scent  
keep fresh in our minds and our hands  
the mercy and generosity you show  
in all your dealings with your beloved people.

May its evergreen boughs,  
untouched by the chill of snow and frost,  
embolden us in our commitment to love and largesse,  
as we too refuse the chill of consumerism and greed.  

Bless the land that provided this tree,  
and bless the land that now holds up our home.

May we remember the bounty of the land  
as we seek to make ourselves native to it  
and to honor its past, present, and future inhabitants.

We have nothing that we did not first receive;  
we give nothing except what we have received.  
Bless us with your presence as we prepare, during this Advent season,  
to receive what you have to give,  
and give what we have been given.

Amen.
