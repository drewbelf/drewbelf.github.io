My review of Aeyelt Even-Ezra's wonderful monograph, *Ecstasy in the Classroom: Trance, Self, and the Academic Profession in Medieval Paris*, is now available on *Reading Religion*, the [American Academy of Religion](https://www.aarweb.org/)'s book review site. I found it a thoroughly engaging discussion of an oft-neglected generation of scholastic theologians, with (it seems to me) relevance to contemporary questions of the nature of academic theology, its methods and aims, and how academic theologians ought to understand what it is they're up to. I do recommend checking it out, if that sort of thing interests you.
