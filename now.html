		<p><span class="title">January 08, 2025. 01:14 a.m. </span>Lately my focus has been getting ready for the spring semester. Iʼm teaching two courses Iʼve taught before: two sections of The Way of Francis & Clare & two sections of Catholic Theology. Iʼm trying to make minimal changes to both courses. The biggest adjustments have been made to Catholic Theology: this is the first time Iʼm teaching the course since I started running writing assignments in class, so I need to adjust the course schedule to make room for that.</p>
